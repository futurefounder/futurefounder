# Hi there, I am Jesse!

🧑🏾‍💻 I make things online with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Next.js.

🤹🏾 In the past I worked in marketing for a decade and succesfully failed a bootstrapped small business "¯\ \_(ツ)_/¯"

📚 In addition to my freelance work, I'm currently pursuing a Master's degree in Media Informatics.

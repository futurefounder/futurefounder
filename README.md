# Hi there, I am Jesse!

I'm a web developer (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Next.js).
In my previous professional life, I managed media budgets from big corporations and helped them plan, execute and evaluate ad campaigns over the course of a little over 10 years.
I also launched a failed a a boutique remote team building service "¯\_(ツ)_/¯"
